<h1 id="title">How Things Work Laptop</h1>
<p style="font-size: 35px; padding-left: 10px;"> For our project we took apart a laptop. Laptops are very different from desktops, they have to be more compact and some of their parts have to have different components to make them work. During this presentation we will go over the hard drive, the RAM, the CPU and a small bit of the motherboard. We will also look at how some parts change from desktop to laptop. </p>
