<p class="text3">Clock Speed is the frequency that a processor runs at (ex. Hz, GHz) the higher the faster.The socket and chipset is the  formations of pins on the bottom of the CPU and Motherboard. The two socket types are LGA and PGA. The architecture consist of 32-Bit, 64-bit, 86x=32-bit. The make and model is either a Intel or AMD and only works with motherboards built to use one of the two brands and only one of them. Host Bus Speed is the speed in which data is transferred between the processor and the chipset and the faster it is the better the performance. Cache Size is used to improve performance and can run at 128KB, 256KB,512KB, 1MB, or 2MB. Process Size is a lithography process that reduces process size. It is used to come in 350 nm, 250 nm, and 180 nm (nm = Nanometers) Nanometers are one billionth of a meter. Newer ones use 250 nm, 180 nm, and 130nm. The goal is to get down to 65nm. 64 bit support  was not really needed until windows vista and is back compatible with 32 bit software. Protected execution stops executable code from a non executable memory space. Power Reduction reduces the processor speed when idle or lightly loaded. Dual core support intel and AMD put two cores to push the boundaries of what they could do. AMD (Advanced Micro Devices) is an American multinational semiconductor company based in Santa Clara, California, that develops computer processors and related technologies for business and consumer markets.   </p>
